To begin editing game content, extract the files from H3EK.7z to this folder, by using the 'H3EK (Extract).bat' batch file.

The data folder contains source files relating to each scenario's HSC (HaloScript) files.

The tools installer does not automatically extract files, to avoid future tool updates overwriting any content you may have made changes to.
